### CI/CD

Currently, Vald contains mainly 3 types of CI/CD pipelines running on GitHub action:

- Build and deploy pipelines
- Testing pipelines
- Linter pipelines

And these pipelines are executed when a pull request is created.

| Pipeline name                            | Description                                           |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Build docker image: {image name}         | Pipeline to build docker image of specific image      |
| Coverage                                 | Execute code test coverage report                     |
| Run tests / Run tests for {package name} | Run unit test on the specific package                 |
| Run e2e {target}                         | Execute End-to-end testing                            |
| Run Helm lint / {chart name}             | Execute linter for Helm chart files                   |
| reviewdog - {target}                     | Execute reviewdog to review the changes on the target |
| DeepSource - {target}                    | Execute DeepSource to analysis target files           |

About the `Build docker image` pipeline, it will build the docker image for the specific tag and upload it to the [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vdaas).

Specifically, it builds the docker image on every pull request and tags the image as `pr-{pull request number}`.

Whenever a pull request is merged into the main branch, a nightly build will be built and uploaded to the DockerHub.

When Vald release, this pipeline will build the docker image with a specific version (e.g. `v1.6.1`) and also update the `latest` tag image.

About the `Run e2e` pipeline, it will execute the end-to-end testing and fails if any error occurred.

This pipeline will be executed only if the label `e2e/{target}` is added to the pull request.

Please note that if you are working in a forked repository, all the CI/CD pipelines will not be executed automatically. You may need to ask the Vald owner to grant access by adding the `ci/approved` label to the pull request to execute the pipelines.

### Create development branch

Before working on changes, you need to create a development branch on your forked branch.

Name the development branch `[type]/[area]/[description]`.

| Field       | Explanation                           | Naming Rule                                                                                                                 |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type        | The PR type                           | The type of PR can be a feature, bug, refactoring, benchmark, security, documentation, dependencies, ci, test, etc...       |
| area        | Area of context                       | The area of PR can be gateway, agent, agent-sidecar, lb-gateway, etc...                                                     |
| description | Summarized description of your branch | The description must be hyphenated. Please use [a-zA-Z0-9] and a hyphen as characters, and do not use any other characters. |

(\*) If you changed multiple areas, please list each area with "-".

For example, when you add a new feature for internal/servers, the name of the branch will be `feature/internal/add-newfeature-for-servers`.

```bash
git checkout -b [type]/[area]/[description]
```

### Make changes

In this section, we will briefly describe how to make changes to Vald.

Before making changes, please make sure you know what you are doing and know about which part of the source code is required to change, please do not change the code which is unnecessary.

#### Code changes

If you are making source code changes, please follow and understand our [coding guideline](./docs/contributing/coding-style.md) to follow our coding style to keep the coding style consistent.

If you have discussed the design and the requirement of the changes with Vald members, please follow the design and the requirement discussed.

After your changes are made, we suggest you execute the following command to generate the necessary test stubs and format the source code.

```bash
make gotests/gen # execute gotests tools to generate unit test code stubs
make format # format go and yaml files
```

#### Document & image changes

In Vald, the documents are written in Markdown format and stored in the `docs` folder. Eventually, documents will be deployed to the [Vald official website](https://vald.vdaas.org/).

In Vald, we support some styles specific to the official website to display different types of content.

We provide the following CSS class for the website:

| CSS class name | Description                              |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| caution        | Display the content as a caution message |
| warning        | Display the content as a warning message |
| note           | Display the content as a note message    |

To apply the above CSS class, quote the sentence to the div with the CSS class name.

For example, to quote the sentence as a warning message:

```html
<div class="warning">This is warning message!!</div>
```

About the images in the document, we are using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) to draw the image.

All the images of the document are stored in the `assets/docs` directory, and each of the images should contain a `.drawio` extension file and the `svg` or `png` file.

This `.drawio` file is the source file and can only be opened on [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/).

Please find [here](https://www.diagrams.net/features) for more about how to use diagrams.net.

After creating or modifying the image on diagrams.net, please store and update the `.drawio`, and export the image to the `.svg` file to the Vald repository.

#### Test your changes

Please make sure to test and validate your changes before adding and committing your changes.

For code changes, please refer to [this document](./docs/contributing/testing-guideline.md) for more detail about how to test your changes.

### Add and commit changes

After verifying the changes, you need to add your changes and push them to your development branch.

Please add the files that are related to your changes only.

```bash
git add [file1] [file2] ...
```

And please write a brief description of the commit message, and push it to your forked repository.

```bash
git commit --signoff -m '[commit message]'
git push origin [type]/[area]/[description]
```

### Create Pull Request

After committing your changes, you may create a pull request to ask for accepting the changes.

Please create the pull request to the Vald repository under `vdaas` organization.

Each pull request and commit should be small enough to contain only one purpose, for easier review and tracking.
Please fill in the description on the pull request and write down the overview of the changes.

#### Pull Request labels

Labels in the pull request indicate what kind of the changes is, and provide some extra feature to the pull request.

Please choose the correct type label on the pull request, we provide the following type label in Vald:
