# FAQ

This page shows the answers to the common questions.

Please refer to [the troubleshooting page](../user-guides/troubleshooting.md) when you encounter operation problems.

## Component

### What is the ingress filter?

The ingress filter is the user-defined component that connects to the `vald-filter-gateway` component.
For example, you can convert object data (e.g., image binary, text, etc.) to the vector using your ML models as pre-process of each request.

### What is the egress filter?

The egress filter is the user-defined component that connects to the vald-filter-gateway component.
You can use it for filtering search results, e.g., when you'd like to get a white T-shirt list, use it to remove other colors of T-shirts from search results that the vald-lb-gateway component returns.

### Is Vald Index Manager recommended using?

We recommend using it when youâ€™d like to operate as a cluster.
It helps you to manage indexing timing for each Vald Agent.

## Custom options

### What are the pluggable options?

Vald has three pluggable options:

1. Backup with the external storage for Vald Agent
   - You can connect the external storage, like S3, GCS, etc., to the Vald Agent Sidecar component for backup.
1. Algorithm of the core engine for Vald Agent
   - We're going to add another algorithm in the near future.
1. Filtering with filter gateway
   - You can filter the search results by your own defined filter component by connecting to the filter gateway before returning the search result.
   - You can convert object data to vector by own defined ingress filter component by connection to filter gateway before inserting.

## Deployment

### How to deploy the Vald cluster?

We recommend using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) for deploying the Vald cluster.
You can deploy by following the steps.

1. Install Helm(v3~) and prepare the Kubernetes cluster
1. Configure `Helm chart` as your demand
1. Deploy by Helm command

## API

### Is there any support for bulk inserts?

Vald provides `MultiInsert` and `StreamInsert` for bulk insert.
Please refer to [the insert API documentation](../api/insert.md) for more detail.

Vald also provides `MultiXXX` and `StreamXXX` as bulk operations for each service.
For more detail, please refer to [the API document overview](https://vald.vdaas.org/docs/api/).

## Data

### Can Vald handle multi-embedding vectors?

Unfortunately, the current Vald cannot directly handle multi-embedding spaces with a single Vald cluster.
You have to choose one of two options to use the multi-embedding vectors in Vald.

1. Deploy multiple Vald cluster
1. Covert vector to new vector in the specific space by some methods

### How to backup index data?

There are three ways to backup index data:

1. Using external storage (S3, GCS)
1. Using Persistent Volume
1. Using the external storage and Persistent Volume

<!-- TODO: change link when publish the backup configuration page -->

Please refer to [the sample configurations](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/tree/main/charts/vald/values).
