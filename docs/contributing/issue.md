# Issue

[Issues](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

An issue can be a bug report, feature request, or security issue report.

We welcome you to give us ideas to improve Vald or report any issue that exists in Vald by creating an issue on the Vald repository.

Please also feel free to ask anything on [Vald Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/vald-community/shared_invite/zt-db2ky9o4-R_9p2sVp8xRwztVa8gfnPA).

## Propose a new issue

If you have found something that should be updated in Vald, search open issues to see if someone else has already talked about it.

If it is something new, please open a new issue using the following template:

- [Bug report](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug%2C+priority%2Fmedium%2C+team%2Fcore&template=bug_report.md&title=)
- [Security issue report](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fsecurity%2C+priority%2Fmedium%2C+team%2Fcore%2C+team%2Fsre&template=security_issue_report.md&title=)
- [Feature request / Proposal](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Ffeature%2C+priority%2Flow%2C+team%2Fcore&template=feature_request.md&title=)

Please fill in the information written on the template to help us to understand what you think.

## Bug Report

A bug is a demonstrable problem that produces an incorrect result or behaves in unintended ways.

Bug reports are helpful for developers who maintain the Vald project.
A good bug report should not leave others needing to constantly ask you for more information.
Please try to write as detailed as possible in your bug report.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Vald are you using (vald docker image version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Please submit the bug report [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug%2C+priority%2Fmedium%2C+team%2Fcore&template=bug_report.md&title=)

## Security Issue Report

The Vald team and community have a serious concern about security issues.

Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to the security channel in [Vald Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/vald-community/shared_invite/zt-db2ky9o4-R_9p2sVp8xRwztVa8gfnPA).

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings.

If the security issue is caused by a third-party module, we will contact the module owner and ask for a fix.

We will consider using another third-party module if the vulnerable module is not actively maintained anymore.

Please submit the security issue report [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fsecurity%2C+priority%2Fmedium%2C+team%2Fcore%2C+team%2Fsre&template=security_issue_report.md&title=)

## Feature Request / Proposal

Feature request and proposal is welcome.

Before creating the feature request or proposal, please make sure your idea fits the project.

You can request the feature or propose a new idea and convince the project maintainers to accept your request.

Please provide the problem and solution associated with the request in as much detail as possible.

NOTE: If you’d like to contribute to the new feature which may affect the current Vald architecture or design, you should discuss it with the Vald team first.

Please submit the feature request or proposal [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Ffeature%2C+priority%2Flow%2C+team%2Fcore&template=feature_request.md&title=)
