# Observability Configuration

Observability for the Vald cluster helps to check each Vald component status by monitoring metrics, logs, and traces.
By enabling observability, you can monitor and visualize the number of indexes, the timing of creating indexes, the number of RPC, CPU resource usage, Memory resource usage, events, etc.

This page shows the best practice for applying observing features by constructing an observability environment and setting the Vald Helm chart.

## Arhitecture

Vald conforms [OpenTeremetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/otlp/) and does NOT depend on any commercial data format.

<img src="../../assets/docs/guides/observability-configuration/architecture.png" />

OpenTelemetry Collector handles receiving / processing / exporting the telemetry data, which does NOT depend on the vendors' format.
All Vald components can send OTLP-compliant telemetry data, like metrics, traces, or logs, to the OpenTelemerty Collector.
The telemetry data is used to monitor or visualize with the observing tools.

## Build an observing environment

The recommended observability environment consists of the following:

- Cert-Manager
- Jaeger Operator and Jaeger
- Prometheus Operator and Prometheus
- Grafana
- OpenTelemetry Operator and OpenTelemtry Collector

Vald provides [the default manifests](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/tree/main/k8s/metrics) and [the make commands](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/blob/main/Makefile.d/k8s.mk) for deploying those components.
Please refer to the following sections to deploy each component.

<div class="notice">
You can change parameters such as the export host by editing the manifest for your demands.
</div>

### Cert-Manager

A `Cert-Manager` is required to enable to use of operators on the Kubernetes Cluster.

```bash
make k8s/external/cert-manager/deploy
```

### Jaeger Operator and Jaeger

Jaeger is helpful for monitoring trace data. It can be available by running the following:

```bash
make k8s/metrics/jaeger/deploy
```

### Prometheus Operator and Prometheus

Vald recommends using Prometheus as a backend service by the following command to monitor the metrics data.

```bash
make k8s/metrics/prometheus/operator/deploy
```

### Grafana

Vald recommends using Grafana to visualize metrics data.

```bash
make k8s/metrics/grafana/deploy
```

### OpenTelemetry Operator and OpenTelemetry Collector

Vald uses OpenTelemetry Collector to get the telemetry data and export it to monitor backend components.
The following command deploys OpenTelemtry Collector via OpenTelemerty Collector.

<div class="warn">
Before executing the following command, please ensure the Prometheus operator runs healthy.
</div>

```bash
make k8s/otel/operator/deploy k8s/otel/collector/deploy
```

### Deploy Observability components with a simple command

If you would like to deploy observability components with a simple command, please use the following command.

```bash
make k8s/external/cert-manager/deploy k8s/monitoring/deploy
```

## Configure Helm chart

This section shows how to set `values.yaml` to enable each Vald component to send its own telemetry data.

The setting points are the following:

1. Enable observability feature
1. Enable sending system metrics
1. Enable sending trace data
1. Set OpenTelemetry parameters

<div class="notice">
The general settings are described for convenience, but individual settings are possible for each component by editing `[component].observability`. 
</div>

### Enable observability feature

To enable the observability feature, you must set `defaults.observability.enabled` as `true`.

```yaml
defaults:
  observability:
    # enable observability
    enabled: true
```

### Enable sending system metrics

Each Vald component sends the system metrics by editing `defaults.observability.metrics`.
All metrics are enabled by default.
Vald recommends using default values unless there is a specific reason.

```yaml
defaults:
  observability:
    # enable version info metrics
    metrics:
      enable_version_info: true
      # If the enable_version_info setting is true, this information will be added to the keys of the version info metrics.
      version_info_labels:
        - "vald_version"
        - "server_name"
        - "git_commit"
        - "build_time"
        - "go_version"
        - "go_os"
        - "go_arch"
        - "ngt_version"
      # enable memory metrics
      enable_memory: true
      # enable goroutine metrics
      enable_goroutine: true
      # enable cgo metrics
      enable_cgo: true
```

### Enable sending trace data

Please set `defaults.observability.trace.enabled` as `true` to enable sending trace data.
The default value is `false`.

```yaml
defaults:
  observability:
    trace:
      # enable to send trace data
      enabled: true
```

### OpenTelemetry settings

This section shows the detailed settings for sending telemetry data.

#### Specify OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint

To send the telemetry data, you must set the OpenTelemetry Collector's endpoint to `defaults.observability.otlp.collector_endpoint`.
The default value is not set.

<div class="warn">
It is required to send telemetry data.
</div>

```yaml
defaults:
  observability:
    otlp:
      collector_endpoint: "opentelemetry-collector-collector.default.svc.cluster.local:4317"
```

#### Specify the Telemetry attribute

You can add the component information to the attribute of telemetry data by editing `defaults.observability.otlp.attirbute`.
E.g., when setting `vald-agent-ngt-0` as `agent.observability.otlp.attribute.pod_name`, `target_pod: vald-agent-ngt-0` will be added to the attribute.
These attributes are set auto by the environment values, so Vald recommends using default values unless there is a specific reason.

```yaml
defaults:
  observability:
    otlp:
      attribute:
        # deployed namespace
        namespace: vald
        # pod name
        pod_name: vald-agent-ngt-0
        # deployed node name
        node_name: kube-worker01
        # service name
        service_name: vald-agent-ngt
```

#### Customize send configuration

You can modify the sending telemetry data behavior by changing the `default.observability.otlp` parameters.

```yaml
defaults:
  observability:
    otlp:
      # Maximum duration for constructing a batch from the queue. The Processor forcefully sends available spans when timeout is reached.
      trace_batch_timeout: "1s"
      # Maximum duration for exporting trace spans
      trace_export_timeout: "1m"
      # Maximum batch size of trace spans.
      trace_max_export_batch_size: 1024
      # Maximum queue size to buffer trace spans for delayed processing.
      trace_max_queue_size: 256
      # Export interval for metrics
      metrics_export_interval: "1s"
      # Maximum duration for exporting metrics
      metrics_export_timeout: "1m"
```

#### gRPC Configuration

The interceptor configuration is required to send the metrics and trace data related to gRPC.
You can add the interceptor to the server-side and client-side by editing `defaults.server_config.servers.grpc.server.grpc.interceptors` parameters.

```yaml
defaults:
  server_config:
    servers:
      grpc:
        server:
          grpc:
            # gRPC Server interceptor.
            interceptors:
              - TraceInterceptor
              - MetricInterceptor
  grpc:
    # gRPC Client interceptor.
    client:
      dial_option:
        interceptors:
          - TraceInterceptor
```

## Monitoring telemetry data

Telemetry data can be monitored using Grafana, Jaeger, etc.
Vald publishes [the sample manifest](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/blob/main/charts/vald/values/dev-observability.yaml), which enables Grafana and Jaeger.

You can apply it after creating an observability environment.

<div class="notice">
The default manifests don't set ingress host.<BR>
You can monitor the browser by port forwarding or define the ingress host by yourself.
</div>

## Cleanup

Lastly, the Vald cluster will be removed by executing the following command.

```bash
helm uninstall vald
```

Also, the observability components will be removed by executing the following command.

```bash
make k8s/monitoring/delete k8s/external/cert-manager/delete
```

And the observability components can also be removed by executing the following command.

```bash
make k8s/otel/collector/delete \
  k8s/otel/operator/delete \
  k8s/metrics/grafana/delete \
  k8s/metrics/jaeger/delete \
  k8s/metrics/prometheus/operator/delete \
  k8s/external/cert-manager/delete
```
