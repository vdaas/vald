# Vald Agent

Vald Agent is the core component of the Vald cluster.

Mainly, it consists of 1 or 2 small components, Vald Core and Vald Agent sidecar, depending on the use case.

This page introduces the overview and features of Vald Agent.

## Responsibility

Vald Agent is responsible for:

- Store index data along to the user requests
  - The store destination is In-Memory, Volume Mounts, Persistent Volume, or External Storage.
- Search the nearest neighbor vectors of the request vector and return the search result

## Features

Vald Agent has two components, `core` and `sidecar`.

This chapter shows the characteristics of each small component.

### Core

`Core` is responsible for the main features of Vald Agent.

It uses a specific algorithm, and you can choose one algorithm depending on your needs.

Vald provides:

- Vald Agent NGT

as core algorithm layer.

#### Vald Agent NGT

Vald Agent NGT uses [NGT](https://github.com/yahoojapan/NGT) as an algorithm.

The main functions are the followings:

- Insert
  - Request to insert new vectors into the NGT.
  - Requested vectors are stored in the `vqueue`.
- Search
  - Get the nearest neighbor vectors of the request vector from NGT indexes.
- Update
  - Create a request to update the specific vectors to the new vectors.
  - Requested vectors are stored in the `vqueue`.
- Remove
  - Create a request to remove the specific vectors from NGT indexes.
  - Requested vectors are stored in the `vqueue`.
- GetObject
  - Get the information on the indexed vectors.
- Exist
  - Check whether the specific vectors are already inserted or not.
- CreateIndex
  - Create a new NGT index structure in memory using vectors stored in the `vqueue` and the existing NGT index structure if it exists.
- SaveIndex
  - Save metadata about NGT index information to the internal storage.

<div class="notice">
You have to control the duration of CreateIndex and SaveIndex by configuration.

These methods don’t always run when getting the request.

</div>

<div class="warning">
As you see, Vald Agent NGT can only search the nearest neighbors from the NGT index.

You have to wait to complete the CreateIndex and SaveIndex functions before searching.

</div>

Please refer to [Go Doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vdaas/vald@v1.3.1/pkg/agent/core/ngt/service) for other functions.

#### Vald Agent Faiss

Vald Agent Faiss uses [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) as an algorithm.

The main functions are the followings:

- Insert
  - Request to insert new vectors into the Faiss.
  - Requested vectors are stored in the `vqueue`.
  - Cache a fixed number of verctors for Faiss training.
  - Once Faiss trained in CreateIndex, the vector is never cached for Faiss training.
- Search
  - Get the nearest neighbor vectors of the request vector from Faiss indexes.
  - radius/epsilon is search config for NGT and has no meaning in Faiss.
- Update
  - Create a request to update the specific vectors to the new vectors.
  - Requested vectors are stored in the `vqueue`.
- Remove
  - Create a request to remove the specific vectors from Faiss indexes.
  - Requested vectors are stored in the `vqueue`.
- Exist
  - Check whether the specific vectors are already inserted or not.
- CreateIndex
  - Create a new Faiss index structure in memory using vectors stored in the `vqueue` and the existing Faiss index structure if it exists.
  - If a certain number of vectors required for Faiss training are not cached, they will not be trained.
  - If Faiss is not trained, no index is generated.
- SaveIndex
  - Save metadata about Faiss index information to the internal storage.

Unimplemented functions are the followings:

- GetObject
- SearchByID
- StreamXXX
- MultiXXX

<div class="notice">
Same as Agent NGT, You have to control the duration of CreateIndex and SaveIndex by configuration.

These methods don’t always run when getting the request.

</div>

<div class="warning">
As you see, Vald Agent Faiss can only search the nearest neighbors from the Faiss index.

You have to wait to complete the CreateIndex and SaveIndex functions before searching.

</div>

### Sidecar

`Sidecar` saves the index metadata file to external storage like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

The main functions are:

- Backup
  - When `Agent Core` completes creating the index metadata files, `Sidecar` hooks to store them in the external storage.

- Restore
  - When the Vald Agent Pod restarts, the index structure is restored from the external backup files.
